URI Compression For Transport

# Notes

None of this code is very clean. This was all done pretty quickly mostly for fun.

Having a way to compress URIs and send them as "blocks" of Base64 ( or some other encoding )

is something I have wanted for a time. 

I wanted to compress them because it annoys me to encode it in Base64 but be taking up more space.

I tried using Gzip, but there were no gains.

I have a plan to improve this, but it is getting some gains that make me happy right now. 

# ALL IS GOOD!

( except for the code quality, and repository organization !! Like I said, this was "thrown" together very quickly, the only focus being on getting it to work! Thanks for reading :) )
